summary: During the COVID-19 pandemic many scientists can't proceed with their usual lab experiments anymore and move to online versions of their studies. But setting up a JATOS instance is not always easy. We want to support the scientific community by providing a JATOS server for free.

The link to the JATOS server is at the end of the page. But first the playing rules:

### Playing rules

**Time frame**

Extended until end of September - if you want it extended even longer feel free to 'buy us a coffee' to pay for the server.

For now we plan to offer this server until the end of ~~August~~ ~~September~~ ~~October~~ ~~November~~ ~~December 2020~~ January 2021. It's also possible that we limit the signing in of new users if we find that the load on the server becomes too high and therefore a free service is unsustainable.

**Please talk to us before you run your study with participants if**

* you want to run a study with many participants at the same time (e.g. send out a link by Twitter, Facebook etc.)
* you have high data volume ( >1 MB per component) in your result data or result files of your study
* you want to upload audio/video in your study

All these will increase the traffic, and therefore the server costs, so please just check with us that it's within our budget. 

**Privacy and ethics**

* This JATOS server is hosted in the cloud (Digital Ocean), within the European Union and uses encryption for all network traffic. So you should check whether a cloud-hosted server complies to the ethics regulations of your institution.
* _experiments.jatos.org_ or JATOS itself does not store user information apart from what is necessary to create the user account (username, name).
* More can be found under: [http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html](http://www.jatos.org/Data-Privacy-and-Ethics.html)

**Backup your result data**

Right now _experiments.jatos.org_ is backed up only on a weekly basis. Please export your result data on a regular basis since otherwise in the (unlikely) case of a server failure your data might get lost. Sadly, we will probably not have the capacity to help you troubleshoot or recover lost data.  

**Research only**

No private use, no commercial use.

**Support us**

The server costs money. Please consider donating via buymeacoffee.com (coffee cup in the bottom right).

### FAQ
**- How much does it cost to run the experiments.jatos.org server per month?**

We pay about 35€/month to keep the server running, and you can contribute towards that by clicking on the Buy-me-a-coffee button at the bottom right of this page.

**- You plan to keep the server running until ~~November December 2020~~ January 2021. I will not be able to finish data collection until ~~February 2021~~ March 2021. Can you guarantee that the server will continue to run?**

The short answer is no.
This is because JATOS is our side project. If the server is down (which happens only seldom), we will not always able to bring it back up immediately. Also, the server has so far ran well with minimal maintenance from our side. But some studies are less well-behaved than others. This is not intentional, but sometimes there is too much traffic due to studies submitting data too often, etc. If something like this happens, we might reach the server's capacity and have to turn it off. (Again, this hasn't happened yet, but we cannot guarantee that it never will).
We’ll also be (really) busy in the first half of 2021. 

**- But I can pay! Would you keep it up then?**

We feel uneasy about asking for money in advance in exchange for a guarantee that the server runs, because we can’t do that for sure (see above). The Buy-me-a-coffee button is meant to be used post-hoc, after you’ve enjoyed the software. Not before, as a commercial agreement. That's not what we're doing.
If the best option is not available [asking your institution for a sever](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-a-server.html), the next best and safest option is to [get your own Digital Ocean server](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html). Or on [AWS](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-in-Amazons-Cloud-without-Docker.html). Or some other cloud provider. This way you would be entering on a commercial agreement with a proper company, and they will have some obligations. You will be able to manage the server yourself, get receipts, etc. If this is not an option for you and you decide to contribute to the experiments server, that’s fine. Just be aware that we simply cannot promise 100% that it will be up for all the time.

**-So what’s your suggestion?**

We’ve paid for the first few months, and the coffees bought by others have extended the server for a long time. We suggest you use the server for free. If it works for you and you’re happy, pay the love forwards and buy us a couple of coffees.
